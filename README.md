## How does it works?

  This Microservice works under geopy python library and FastAPI.
  This might be used and implemented as third Party API. It uses only two HTTP request Method: Get and Post.

   It has only (3) endPoints availables.
   
   #### Get Address Details by GPS Coordinates
   
   - `https://geolocalizacao-api.herokuapp.com/details?address=` -
     It is a Get method and you need to pass the address details in form of `latitude` and `longitude`.
   
   Follow up this example:
   if we have `28.5487558`, `77.2714498`, as the latitude and longitude consequently, the response of this request is going to be
